# Authentication Patterns

This document outlines the authentication patterns and important locations for auth-related code.

## Authentication Flow
The authentication system is implemented in the following locations:

- Core Logic: `src/domain/services/auth/authenticate-with-email/`
- HTTP Routes: `src/http/routes/v1/auth/`
- Error Handling: `src/shared/errors/auth/`

## Key Components

### Authentication Service
The authentication service handles user authentication flows including:
- Email-based authentication
- Session management
- Password handling

### Session Management
Session handling utilities are located in `src/utils/sessions/` and include:
- Session creation
- Session validation
- Session expiration

### Password Management
Password-related utilities in `src/utils/password/` handle:
- Password hashing
- Password validation
- Security measures

## Error Handling
Authentication-specific errors are defined in `src/shared/errors/auth/` for consistent error handling across the application.
