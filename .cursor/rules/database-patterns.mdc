# Database Patterns

This document outlines the database architecture and data access patterns used in the project.

## Database Architecture

### ORM Configuration
The project uses Drizzle ORM for database operations:
- [drizzle.config.ts](mdc:drizzle.config.ts): Main ORM configuration
- Database schemas in `src/db/schemas/`
- Migrations stored in `priv/migrations/`

## Data Access Patterns

### Repository Pattern
Data access is implemented using the repository pattern:
- Repositories are located in `src/db/repositories/`
- Each entity has its own repository implementation
- Repositories abstract database operations from business logic

### Caching
User-related caching implementations are located in `src/utils/cache/users/` to improve performance for frequently accessed data.

## Database Operations

### Migrations
- Migration files are stored in `priv/migrations/`
- Migration metadata is tracked in `priv/migrations/meta/`

### Best Practices
1. Always use repositories for database access
2. Keep database schemas in `src/db/schemas/`
3. Implement proper error handling for database operations
4. Use transactions for operations that modify multiple records
