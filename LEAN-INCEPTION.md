# Lean Inception: Tesseract

## 1. Product Vision
Tesseract aims to empower developers to rapidly build, deploy, and scale secure crypto and blockchain applications, abstracting away the complexity of blockchain infrastructure. It provides a robust Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) platform tailored for cryptocurrency and Web3 development.

## 2. Business Goals
- Accelerate time-to-market for crypto and blockchain apps.
- Lower the barrier for Web2 and Web3 developers to build on blockchain.
- Provide secure, scalable, and reliable backend services for crypto applications.
- Foster a developer ecosystem around Tesseract APIs and SDKs.
- Enable new business models via easy blockchain integration.

## 3. Personas
- **Web3 Developers:** Building dApps, wallets, or DeFi protocols.
- **Web2 Developers:** Integrating blockchain features into existing apps.
- **Crypto Startups:** Launching new products with minimal backend overhead.
- **Enterprises:** Adding blockchain capabilities to legacy systems.
- **Hobbyists/Students:** Experimenting with blockchain and crypto tech.

## 4. Product Features (as per MVP)
- **Blockchain Integration:**
  - Ethereum, Bitcoin, and Solana support
  - Address management, balance, transaction history
  - Transaction broadcasting, simulation, and gas estimation
  - Block and event monitoring
  - Smart contract interaction (including ERC-20, ERC-721)
- **Web3 Services:**
  - ENS resolution, IPFS integration
  - Token and NFT metadata
  - DeFi price feeds
- **Wallet Services:**
  - Secure wallet creation, encryption, backup, and recovery
  - HD wallet support, read-only access
  - Transaction simulation
- **Authentication & Security:**
  - Email/password and Web3 (wallet signature) auth
  - 2FA, API key management, rate limiting
  - EIP-712 typed data signing
- **Developer Tools:**
  - REST API, WebSocket support
  - API documentation, JS/TS SDK
  - Web3 event webhooks, contract verification
- **Analytics:**
  - Transaction monitoring dashboard
  - Usage statistics, error tracking, gas analytics

## 5. MVP Scope (Must Have)
- Core blockchain integration (Ethereum, Bitcoin)
- Wallet creation, encryption, and backup
- REST API for all core features
- Web3 authentication and 2FA
- Smart contract interaction (read/write, events)
- ENS and IPFS support
- Basic analytics dashboard
- API key management and rate limiting

## 6. Not in MVP (Won't Have for Now)
- Multi-chain expansion (beyond Ethereum, Bitcoin, Solana)
- Advanced wallet features (multi-sig, hardware wallets)
- Smart contract deployment tools
- Automated compliance and advanced analytics
- Enhanced security (beyond 2FA, rate limiting)

## 7. Product Increment Slices (User Journeys)
- As a developer, I can create a wallet and retrieve its address and balance.
- As a developer, I can broadcast and simulate blockchain transactions.
- As a developer, I can interact with smart contracts (read/write, events).
- As a developer, I can authenticate via Web2 or Web3 methods.
- As a developer, I can monitor transactions and receive real-time updates.
- As a developer, I can manage API keys and view usage analytics.

## 8. Success Metrics
- Number of active developers and API keys
- Number of transactions processed via API
- Time to first successful integration (developer onboarding)
- Uptime and reliability of core services
- User feedback and NPS (Net Promoter Score)

## 9. Open Questions / Risks
- How to prioritize additional blockchain support?
- What compliance/regulatory requirements may arise?
- How to ensure security for wallet management at scale?
- What are the most requested features from early adopters?
